# EE5907 CA2

This is the code for EE5907 CA2.

The aim of this project is to construct a face recognition system via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminative Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). 

Firstly, PCA is used to perform data dimensionality reduction and visualization, in order to understand underlying data distribution. Then two classification methods, LDA and SVM, are used to classify the face images. GMM is used to group the face images. 

To run the models in this file is descibed as follows.

## PCA

`python main.py --model PCA`

## LDA

`python main.py --model LDA`



## SVM

`python main.py --model SVM`


## GMM

`python main.py --model GMM`
